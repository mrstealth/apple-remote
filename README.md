Makes up/down on Apple remote from volume control to BigStepForward and BigStepBack while watching video. Useful for Apple TV 2 (black) users who don't have volume control anyways.

Cut and paste the following into a new text document and save as Joystick.AppleRemote.xml and place in /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/XBMC/userdata/keymaps/
